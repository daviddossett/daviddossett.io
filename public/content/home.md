Hi, I'm David. I'm a designer and maker of software based in Seattle WA. I'm currently leading design for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and building [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) at Microsoft. 

I've been at Microsoft since 2016. Before VS Code, I led design for Aria, a real-time analytics app and platform. I also spent time as a developer building the design system for Customer Insights. I learned the ropes at 8ninths working on AR/VR experiences. 

More soon.
